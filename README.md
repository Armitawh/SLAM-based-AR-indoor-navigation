# SLAM-Based Indoor Navigation Using Augmented Reality

## Overview
This project presents an **indoor navigation system built with Unity**, combining **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** with **Augmented Reality (AR)** techniques. The system enables autonomous exploration, real-time path guidance, and visual navigation cues in indoor environments.

It is designed as an educational and portfolio project for courses in **Autonomous Systems, Robotics, Computer Vision, and AR/VR**.
